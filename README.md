+ The relationship of  Android Studio, Android NDK and Android SDK? SDK is short for Software Development Kit while NDK is Native Development Kit. Therefore, NDK is also a SDK. Long before, there was only SDK and no NDK. But SDK only supports pure java language. So if an engineer wants to use third-party libraries of C/C++, he has to adop some non-official methods like jni to call C/C++. Afterwards, NDK was released in which jni is officially admitted. Therefore, 
  + with SDK, one can use android emulator,
  + with NDK, one can now have easy access to C/C++ programs via jni.
